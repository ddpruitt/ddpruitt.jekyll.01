title: VMWare Workstation 6.0 Beta - Holy Vitalization!
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/12/vmware-workstation-60-beta-holy.html)*.

<p>Just got an email about the 6.0 version of the VMWare Workstation and all I can say is "Wow!"&nbsp; These are the features I am mainly interested in:</p> <ul> <li>Multiple monitor display - You can configure a VM to span multiple monitors, or multiple VMs to each display on separate monitors.  </li><li>Integrated Virtual Debugger - Workstation integrates with Visual Studio and Eclipse so you can deploy, run, and debug programs in a VM directly from your preferred IDE  </li><li>Headless mode - You can run VMs in the background without the Workstation UI </li></ul> <p>These new features will help me at work as it really does fit into my work style.&nbsp; The next PC I get I'm going to install a base system then VM's for everything else, all development will be done in a VM sandboxes.</p> <p>The question now becomes:&nbsp; Will VMServer have these features?</p>
