title: Chasing the Technology

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">A big problem I have with people who consider themselves programmers is that they spend most of their time chasing the technology.&nbsp; They spend more time whack-a-mole code hacking and no time trying to learn the basics, like source control, methodologies or algorithms.</span></p><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">I personally lack in these areas because I do not come from a Computer Science background, but I strive to overcome this.&nbsp; My favorite computer books deal with ways of thinking about and doing programming, not just code cookbooks.&nbsp; I observe my programming habits and change them to be better.&nbsp; I make the effort that I don't see these others making.</span></p><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">I see the chase in people I work with and friends of mine.&nbsp; I see it in people that think they are doing a great job just because the project they are working on compiles, runs and the client likes the pretty interface.&nbsp; Unfortunately they have taken so many short cuts in building their monolithic bag-o-crap that the slightest requirements change pops the poop bag leaving a big nasty mess to clean up.</span></p><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">Or they make a change in the code then forget why they changed it and what they changed now the program breaks.&nbsp; If only they had used soruce control they could roll back to a working copy.</span></p><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">I love the blank stares I get from these chasers when I say that, instead of learning xyz programming language, they should read a programming book, like <strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">The Pragmatic Programmer</span></strong> or <strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">The Mythical Man Month</span></strong>.&nbsp; They look at these books and ask "But where is the CODE?"</span></p><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;">This is when I realize that I have real job security.</span></p>
