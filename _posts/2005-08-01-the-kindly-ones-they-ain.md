title: The Kindly Ones They Ain&#39;t

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2005/08/the-kindly-ones-they-ain.html)*.

<p>I finished reading Sandman #9, <em>The Kindly Ones</em>.&nbsp; This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something.&nbsp; Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut.&nbsp; Then Neil killed Dream.</p><p>I thought, how inappropiate.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think he would acutally kill him, just make him wipe out the furies.&nbsp; But no, Dream goes bye-bye.</p><p>This was actually forshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.</p><p>I am trying to avoid reading any reviews of the final Sandman just so I don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen.&nbsp; After I finish the final I can go back and re-read the Endless Nights.</p>
