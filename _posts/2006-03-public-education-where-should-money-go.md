title: Public Education - Where Should the Money Go?
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/03/public-education-where-should-money-go.html)*.

<p>Why should the government be responsible for paying for my kids education?&nbsp; After all, he is my kid so why should local, state, or federal tax money go to improve his education?</p><p>Because the USA will benefit from my son being educated.&nbsp; The State (meaning local, state and federal governments) will benefit by my son making more money, which means he will spend more, so in both cases he will contribute to the economy and the tax base.</p><p>So from that perspective what is the best way for the State to invest in our kids education?&nbsp; By giving the money directly to the schools and have them decide what the best education is?&nbsp; Or by having the money follow the child so that the parents can decide the best school to send their child to.</p><p>I prefer the later as this increases the competition between schools which should in theory lead to a better education experience.&nbsp; The first choice, giving the school the money, leads to an Education Monopoly and we all know that Monopolies are a <em>Bad Thing</em>.</p>
