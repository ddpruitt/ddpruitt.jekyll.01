<p>I am getting ready to ride out Hurricane Rita.&nbsp; We have a room set up with food,&nbsp;water and other supplies.&nbsp; </p><p>We tried to evacuate but got stuck in traffic; in six hours we only went five miles.&nbsp; By that time we were down to half a tank of gas so we opted to return home.&nbsp; We even thought about attempting it again later that night but the roads were still clogged and there was no gas to be found.</p><p>The winds are just now starting up and the power has flickered several times.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I will get much sleep tonight.</p>
