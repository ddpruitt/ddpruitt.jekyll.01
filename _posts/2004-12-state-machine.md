<p>I have been working with the State Pattern for several months now.&nbsp; It is a great way to control an application in a Kung Fu sort of way.&nbsp; It has a very hands off director feel to it.</p><p>I am planning on writing up a full doc on my take on the pattern and an implimentation of it, based off of the MyXaml MxStateMachine.&nbsp; I like the looks of MyXaml but it seems too declarative for me.&nbsp; I plan to impliment a code generation process to build the State Machine.</p>
