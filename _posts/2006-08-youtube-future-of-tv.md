<p>I have been saying for the last couple of years that once we get true TV on demand we will stop becoming slaves to the networks. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a>&nbsp;are the start of that phenomena.</p><br /><p>The thing I just found out about YouTube is that you can embed videos in any post and not worry about actaully hosting the video.&nbsp; See my post on the <a href="http://blog.ddpruitt.net/2006/08/18/blue-man-group-rocks/">Blue Man Group </a>for an example.</p>
