*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/11/mad-world.html)*.

I keep seeing the commercial for <em>Gears of War</em>, I don't know anything about the game but the background music is one that I know and like.  It is called "Mad World" and I recognize it from the movie Donny Darko.  Part of it goes like this:<br /><blockquote>I find it kind of funny,<br /><br />I find it kind of sad,<br /><br />But the dreams in which I'm dying<br /><br />Are the best I ever had.</blockquote><br />It is one of those songs that forces you to stop and listen.<br /><br />Any way, I thought I might have the song so I went looking in my mp3 collection and couldn't find it.  No problem I'll search iTunes.<br /><br />Do you know how many remakes are of this one song?!  A lot.  Just on iTunes I see over 52 remixes.<br /><br />Wow.
