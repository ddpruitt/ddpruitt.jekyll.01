<p>I know that no socialistic form of government will ever last very long.&nbsp; I know this because, no matter how good the intentions some one will always take advantage of the system.&nbsp; There will always be some one to take advantage of some one elses generosity.&nbsp; </p><p>How do I know this?&nbsp; Because of the Coffee Leaches!</p><p>We have a pretty nice coffee bar in our office.&nbsp; We have fresh beans, good quaility beans, and a grinder.&nbsp; One of the people I work with could be considered a Coffee Snob, but he is a super nice guy.&nbsp; He has no problem going out of his way to help out others.&nbsp; And he loves coffee.&nbsp; He is the one behind the coffee bar and the reason it is so top notch.</p><p>But we also have Coffee Leaches.&nbsp; The ones who always leave just enough coffee in the bottom of the pot so they can, in their little minds, justify not making the next pot.&nbsp; They do not contribute to the effort to make the coffee or in any other way support it.</p><p>Their efforts have proven to me that the Leaches will always create the class system.&nbsp; The doers and the slugs.&nbsp; Because of this I rest easy.</p>
