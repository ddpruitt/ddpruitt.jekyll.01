<p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>And that easy solution must work in a similar way to this: </p> <p>1. Via a GUI app found on the /Administration menu that lists the 10 most wanted proprietary applications and asks the user to check the boxes of the apps he wants to install. Show a license agreement that waives the distro off any legal problems and then download and install the requested software. </p> <p>2. When a user tries to load an mp3 or a .wmv, have patched your multimedia apps (e.g. Sound Juicer, Rhythmbox, Banshee, XMMS, Totem) to inform the user why they can't play these files and ask if he/she wants to download the codecs. If the user says "yes", show the license agreement that waives the distro from any legal problems and download/install the requested software. If installing the MP3 codec, also install the required Gnome mp3 profile so users can actually rip in MP3 with Sound Juicer.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=16284">A Call to Distros: Give Users What They Want - OSNews.com</a> </p> <p>I couldn't agree more with this.&nbsp; When I go to install a Distro the last thing I want to have to do is search the web to find out how to watch YouTube.</p> <p>Linux should just work and I shouldn't have to notice it.</p>
