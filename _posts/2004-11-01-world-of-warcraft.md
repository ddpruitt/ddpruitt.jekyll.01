<p><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/">Blizzard Entertainment - World of Warcraft</a> I have been waiting for over three years for WOW to come out. Is it worth the wait? Am I going to rush and play it? Should I? After all these years are online dungeons even relevant?</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp; My wife bought me the game for Christmas, but she said I can't open it until Christmas!&nbsp; But we are going to Flint, MI for Christmas so I won't be able to play it until New Years Eve, when we get back.&nbsp; Oh the humanity of it all!</p>
