<p>I&rsquo;ve tried several Linux distributions: Redhat, Coral, Suse, Mandrake, Damn Small Linux, Knoppix, Gentoo and finally Debian.&nbsp; Of all of these I was most loyal to Gentoo because it was the distro I learned the most with.&nbsp; The problem with Gentoo though is you spend so much time getting it to run and tweaking it that you don&rsquo;t really get to use the machine for what you want to.</p><p>For example, I tried and successfully setup a Gentoo desktop on a couple of occasions.&nbsp; But, I will never do it again.&nbsp; I have no desire to spend a week or more building KDE or Gnome when I can have a fully running desktop in less than an hour with other distro.</p><p>My main file server is Gentoo and I am&nbsp;leary of updating it.&nbsp; Every time I <em>emerge -u system</em> I have to spend another hour or two cleaning up config files.&nbsp; Then when I reboot the machine I cross my fingers and hope it comes up.</p><p>I have started using Debian and so far I like it.&nbsp; Simple to install, apt-get is just as good as emerge and I don&rsquo;t have to wait days for a compiler to build my system.&nbsp; The plan is to convert the file server to Debian at some point.</p>
