title: Crappy Apps
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2007/10/crappy-apps.html)*.

Why is it that so many crappy apps are out there in the wild?<br /><br />Is it because of the visual tools available in the .Net realm that generate so much crap that the average programmer just does not have time to clean it up?  Or are the developers just too lazy to clean up the mess as they go?
