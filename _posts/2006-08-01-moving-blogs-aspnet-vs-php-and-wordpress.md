title: Moving blogs, ASP.NET vs PHP and WordPress

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/08/moving-blogs-aspnet-vs-php-and-wordpress.html)*.

<p>I moved my permanent blog to here, if you hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&nbsp; It went a whole lot smoother than I thought it would as my main blog was on Blogger.com.&nbsp; I had this sinking feeling that in order to move all my entries I would have to save them one by one then repost them.&nbsp; Boy was I surprised!</p><br /><p>I had originally given thought to switching my hosting to use ASP.Net, the only hold back was that&nbsp; my <a href="http://www.ddpruitt.net/gallery">gallery </a>was using <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a>.&nbsp; But since I am a .NET developer I thought &ldquo;why not use something I know?&rdquo;&nbsp; Wrong attitude!&nbsp; It would cost me more to use a .Net server plus after looking around there were not a whole lot of options when it came to applications.&nbsp; There is DotNetNuke, dasBlog or SubText, plus a handful of galleries.&nbsp; From what I saw none of those approach the maturity of the PHP options.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>I settled on WordPress mainly because I have used it before.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve used numerous CMS applications but I do not want a CMS.&nbsp; I want a blog engine and a gallery.&nbsp; The hosting company provided Gallery already which I use and like,&nbsp;and it does offer PHPNuke but that would not fit my needs.</p><br /><p>So how to handle the migration?&nbsp; Turns out that is all built into WordPress.&nbsp; When I saw that I could import my entire Blogger site I was amazed!&nbsp; The whole installation process was simple and enjoyable.&nbsp; The migration took all of fifteen minutes and that is only because I had to figure out how to dump the two blog entries I had at LiveJournal.</p><br /><p>Why did I leave blogger?&nbsp; I am a adamant fan of almost every thing Google and I have had that blog for ages, but I felt like I had to fight the system more than I needed to.&nbsp; If I wanted categories I would have to either create separate blogs or encode the titles then have some funky search going on.&nbsp; I think the one thing that really made me want to switch was that I could not select individual entries.&nbsp; How lame is that?</p><br /><p>But I am here now.&nbsp; My own domain.&nbsp; My own little space in the wild.</p><br /><p><img align="left" alt="Genghis Darren" border="0" src="http://www.myhosting.com/blog/5339460.jpg" /><a href="http://www.myhosting.com/blog/PCC_20Rulez.jpg"><img align="right" alt="PCC Rulez" border="0" src="http://www.myhosting.com/blog/PCC_20Rulez_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
