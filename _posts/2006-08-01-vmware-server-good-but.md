<p>I&rsquo;ve have discovered virtualization.&nbsp; Actually I started using it several months ago and found that it is GREAT!&nbsp; It Rocks My World!!</p><p>After trying Microsoft's I decided that I preferred VMWare&rsquo;s Virtual Server, mainly because there is a version for Linux.&nbsp; I have a plan to build the ultimate home server using VM&rsquo;s.</p><p>However, tonight I had just downloaded the SourceForge Enterprise VM and was going to play with it but my license key for VMWare Virtual Server had expired.&nbsp; When I tried to get a new one their server returned a nice little Tomcat error:</p><pre><font size="2">javax.servlet.ServletException: JesapiFilter: Invalid Remote Address.</font></pre><p>That sucks because now I have to uninstall the server and install the VMPlayer.&nbsp; blah.&nbsp; But, it is all free so who am I to complan.</p>
