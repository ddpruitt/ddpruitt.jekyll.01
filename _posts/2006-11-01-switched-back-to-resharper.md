title: Switched Back to ReSharper
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/11/switched-back-to-resharper.html)*.

<p>I uninstalled CodeRush and re-installed ReSharper.&nbsp; CodeRush just wasn't doing anything for me productivity wise.&nbsp; I felt that I spent more time fighting it then working with it.</p> <p>Maybe I just feel more comfortable with ReSharper.&nbsp; I feel that with it I don't have to memorize as many key combinations.</p> <p>I'll give it another month and see what I think then.</p>
