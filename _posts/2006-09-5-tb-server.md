title: .5 TB Server

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/09/5-tb-server.html)*.

<p>While&nbsp;rebuilding our home file server I realized that I had about .5 TB of disk space.&nbsp; This is spread across four different sized harddrives but if you&nbsp;add up the total space it is&nbsp;over 600 GB.&nbsp; It is not the full Terabyte server that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to build but it is a step in that direction.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>And I&rsquo;m not doing any RAID.&nbsp; I will be doing <a href="http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/index.html" title="Mike Rubel rsync backups">rsync snapshot backups</a>&nbsp;to one of the harddrives so I am loosing already half my space.&nbsp; When I get enough $$$ I will get more drives and attempt some RAID or Linux LVM.</p><br /><p>I am using Ubuntu on the machine.&nbsp; I started down the road of using straight Debian but soon got real tired of trying to figure out how to make things work.&nbsp; With Ubuntu I would say that 80 to 90% of my hardware problems went away and I didn&rsquo;t have to hunt down any drivers or figure out why I couldn&rsquo;t get a higher screen resolution.&nbsp; My last file server I used Gentoo which rocks, by the way, but I have gotten to the point where I don&rsquo;t want to spend days just setting up the OS.&nbsp; As it is it has taken me a while and multiple installs of Ubuntu just to get the server into a state that I like it.</p><br /><p>Next is setting up a Subversion instance on the machine.&nbsp; It would be a great thing to have my own SVN server that I can get to when ever I need.&nbsp; After that I need to clean up my tech library.</p><br /><p>It just never ends.</p>
