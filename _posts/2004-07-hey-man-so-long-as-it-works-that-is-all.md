<p>So says my bossman at least.&nbsp; And such is the attiutude of a lot of programmers.</p><p>But it is not All That Matters.&nbsp; It is a side affect of doing things right and an accident when you do things wrong.&nbsp; There is more to building software, lots more, and it is unfortunate that some people will never see beyond the short sided goals of "Making it Work."</p><p>It kills me to here people I work with say that.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel that I am the only person innovating, or even just trying to improve my work practices.&nbsp; I have to fight to make them use source control much less follow any kind of standard development procedure.</p><p>I try to lead by example but that does not work.&nbsp; I give up.</p>
