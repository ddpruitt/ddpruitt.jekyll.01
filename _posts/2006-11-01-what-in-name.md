title: What&#39;s in a Name?

<p>I have had the joy of reviewing other peoples code lately and I must say that for the most part there is a total lack of attention to detail.&nbsp; Extensive use of copy paste coding, but the one thing that bugs me the most is the naming convention used.</p> <p>Can you believe that there are still developers that preface there variables with obj?!&nbsp; Is that not just crazy?&nbsp; Of course it is an object, we work in an OOP language.</p> <p>Everyone should stop reading tips and tricks sites and start reading books on how to program.</p>
