<p>I am back in Dallas working at the EPA RRC, assisting with the data management for the Hurricane Katrina and Rita response.&nbsp; It is not something I want to do since I am having to use MS Access.</p><p>My loathing for MS Access is growing on a hourly basis.&nbsp; I feel like an amature doing mundane BS all the while dreaming of building an Eifal Tower.&nbsp; One day&hellip;.</p><p>There is desention amoung the ranks and the captions are unaware&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
