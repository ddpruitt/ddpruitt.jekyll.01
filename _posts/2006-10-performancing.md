Ok, so I found another alternative to BlogJet: Performancing.&nbsp; This is an extension of FireFox so I have to have that installed.<br /><br />So far it looks like it is easy to use.&nbsp; It can't seem to be able to insert an image like Live Writer but I think it will be easier to blog about something I found on the web.<br /><br />I have a feeling I will keep using Live Writer and only use this on occasion.<br /><a href=""></a><br /><br /> <p class="poweredbyperformancing"><strike>powered by </strike><a href="http://performancing.com/firefox"><strike>performancing firefox</strike></a>&nbsp; OK I don't like that Performancing does self promoting.&nbsp; That is a big minus.</p>
