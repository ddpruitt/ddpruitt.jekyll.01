title: 'David Hayden [MVP C#] : Validation Application Block - Integrating It

  Into Your Business Layer'

<blockquote>Now that we have this cool Validation Application Block we want to use it with all our business objects. This should immediately send up a red flag that there will probably be some common functionality among all these business objects in how they use the Validation Application Block. Hence some type of layer supertype ( business base class ) will probably be necessary to contain common functionality to remove code redundancy.</blockquote><br />Source: <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2006/12/28/Validation-Application-Block-_2D00_-Integrating-It-Into-Your-Business-Layer.aspx">David Hayden [MVP C#] : Validation Application Block - Integrating It Into Your Business Layer</a><br /><br />David Hayden presents another great article, this time on the newest addition to the MS EntLib:  <em>Validation Application Block</em>.<br /><br />I go back and forth on the EntLib as a whole.  Parts are great, other parts are overkill.  I love the Data Access Block and use it in tandem with my other data access frameworks (ActiveRecord, NHibernate, etc).  The UI block though, WTF!<br /><br />David's article is a good read.   Go forth and read.
