<h2>Those Who Ignore Standards Are Doomed to Reinvent Them</h2><p>The most Prophetic words&nbsp;I have ever heard.</p><p>This has come into play several times where I work and where I have worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;It boils down to each developer thinking his set of <em>Standards</em> is better then my set of <em>Standards</em>.</p><p>The others should just face reality:&nbsp; I know best so do it my way.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.myhosting.com/blog/smile1.gif" /></p>
