<p>World of Warcraft was finally released last year (w00t!) and for Christmas my wife bought me the Limited Edition.&nbsp; Of course she did not realize what that meant, after all I had been waiting for three years for WOW to come out!</p><p>I am focusing mainly on creating Warriors for now.&nbsp; I have created four different characters, two on a Pacific server and two on one of the Central servers.&nbsp; I found that the Pacific servers are always over crowded and more prone to lag and other issues so I&nbsp;switched to the Central servers.</p><p>I have one main character that I am running now, a Night Elf Warrior.&nbsp; I am following the template from PC Gamer for a High DPS Warrior, going to see how effective it is.&nbsp; Right now the character is level 13 and I am focusing on getting his professional/trade skills higher.&nbsp; Since he is a Warrior he has Blacksmith and Mining.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course he has first aid and cooking, those two are a must.</p>
