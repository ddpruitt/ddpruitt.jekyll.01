title: The Virtual Domain

<p>I've been playing around with VMWare and vitalization for a while now and I have to say I really like it.&nbsp; I have a virtual Ubuntu image that I am using to learn Ruby on Rails with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I installed VMWare's server on my file server so I can run VM's from any PC in my house.</p> <p>So last night I was working on my gateway PC when the thought hit me:&nbsp; Why not create my own virtual domain?&nbsp; I could create an image and install IPCop on it, add three virtual Ethernet cards to the VM and bridge the fourth to a real NIC and viola&nbsp;- Instant Domain.&nbsp; Just add more servers.</p> <p>From there I could add servers to the Green, Orange and Blue&nbsp;Virtual&nbsp;zones and just play around with configurations.&nbsp; I could create a mini-web farm, play around with MySQL replication, a virtual cluster, anything.</p> <p>Granted I would bump into a Hardware wall pretty quick, I dumped all my old PC's so now I don't have that many to play with.&nbsp; But I bet I could still but together something pretty cool.</p>
