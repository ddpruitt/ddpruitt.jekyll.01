title: 'RE: Microsoft: Our strategy with Silverlight has shifted | ZDNet'

â€œSilverlight is our development platform for Windows Phone,â€ he said. Silverlight also has some â€œsweet spotsâ€ in media and line-of-business applications, he said.<br /><br />But when it comes to touting Silverlight as Microsoftâ€™s vehicle for delivering a cross-platform runtime, â€œour strategy has shifted,â€ Muglia told me.<br /><br />via <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-our-strategy-with-silverlight-has-shifted/7834">Microsoft: Our strategy with Silverlight has shifted | ZDNet</a>.<br /><br />I think it is time to move away from the Microsoft platform. Â I'm getting tired of having to learn a new framework every year just to keep up with their changes.<br /><br />I've been using Silverlight at work and I like it but if there is not going to be any support or they totally re-target the platform for just phones, whats the point?<br /><br />Time for python - html5 -Â JavaScriptÂ stack.
