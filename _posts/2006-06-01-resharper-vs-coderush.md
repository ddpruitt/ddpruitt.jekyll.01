title: Resharper vs CodeRush
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/06/resharper-vs-coderush.html)*.

<p>So I used Resharper for a long time and I really liked it.&nbsp; There were a few things I didn&rsquo;t like, especially the time added to a project load.&nbsp; And every once in a while it would lock up.&nbsp; But the features I liked were very useful: Find all usages, simple keyboard shortcuts, code reformatting.&nbsp; But the two most useful things it did was 1) to but a bar along the right side of the screen with orange or red lines for were the code had problems, and 2) clean up the using statements.</p><p>I have been using CodeRush/Refactor Pro&nbsp;for about a month now and really like it as well.&nbsp; I wish it did some of the things that ReSharper did and I wished the refactoring worked more like ReSharper.&nbsp; But I like the polish a lot better and I like the way it shows how blocks of code are related.&nbsp; One of the best features I notices so far is the showing cyclomatic complexity of each method.&nbsp; The code completion is a bit complicated and I haven&rsquo;t spent enough time figuring it out.&nbsp; It is more flexible than ReSharpers.</p><p>Another thing I do not like about CodeRush is the subscription scheme they are switching to.&nbsp; I can see where they would need a continuous money stream to keep the business going.&nbsp; But how am I going to justify paying the CodeRush tax each year when I got the ReSharper upgrade for free?</p><p>So, I like both products.&nbsp; I tried running both at the same time in VS 2003 but after 15 minutes it locked up.&nbsp; The tend to step on each other a lot so I need to figure out how to get them to play nice together.</p>
