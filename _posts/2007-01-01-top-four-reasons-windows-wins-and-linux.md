<p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>Top four reasons Windows wins and Linux loses</p> <p>1. The Installed Base</p> <p>2. PC Vendor Support</p> <p>3. Hardware Vendor Support</p> <p>4. Software Support</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://desktoplinux.com/news/NS6087894103.html">Top four reasons Windows wins and Linux loses</a> </p> <p>To this list I would like to add:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Consistent Package Installation</p> <p>In windows you have MSI files to install stuff with.&nbsp; They are simple to use and pretty much standard for every program I've installed.</p> <p>In Linux I've used RPM's, APT and PORTAGE.&nbsp; Granted they are all easy to use it is still frustrating to me to have to know how to use all three.&nbsp; The less I have to think about something mundane (i.e. installing software) the better it is.</p> <p>What would really rock Linux's world would be a single distribution system that would work with all distributions.&nbsp; That way the distributions could work on making their distro better and not have to worry about maintaining an Open Office or FireFox install.</p>
