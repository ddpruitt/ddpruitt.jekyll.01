<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/09/the-smaq-stack-for-big-data.html"><i>The SMAQ stack for big data - O'Reilly Radar</i></a><i>: "'Big data' is data that becomes large enough that it cannot be processed using conventional methods. Creators of web search engines were among the first to confront this problem. Today, social networks, mobile phones, sensors and science contribute to petabytes of data created daily."</i><div><i><br /></i></div><div>What other types of large data sets can we use this approach on?  The Oil &amp; Gas industry deals with tons of data so maybe SMAQ can be used with it.</div>
