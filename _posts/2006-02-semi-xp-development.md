title: Semi-XP Development

<p>So, we are doing XP want to be development at work.&nbsp; It is more of a war room programming environment and not true paired programming.&nbsp; </p><p>What I am finding that I like more and more is not the coding per say, but the testing and development automation.&nbsp; I have been using TestDriven.NET and mbUnit a lot and am just now starting to explore NCover.&nbsp; Also, have been using NAnt scripting for builds and have installed CruiseControl.NET to see if I can&rsquo;t get an entire build cycle created.</p><p>This is all exciting stuff!</p>
