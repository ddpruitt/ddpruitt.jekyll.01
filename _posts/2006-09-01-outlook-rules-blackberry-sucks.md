title: Outlook Rules + Blackberry == SUCKS
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/09/outlook-rules-blackberry-sucks.html)*.

<p>I just got a Blackberry for work and am having a hard time dealing with it.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t ask for it but if I have to use it I will.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>The real problem I am having is the clash of Outlook rules and my use of folders to organize email's.&nbsp; Because the email's I get are moved into a folder (me being the anal organizational type) they do not get forwarded to the Blackberry.&nbsp; This sucks because I don&rsquo;t get all my email's which defeats the purpose of having the&nbsp;thing.</p><br /><p>I have a plan to solve the problem.&nbsp; A guy I work with says that he does not use folders to organize his email's, just sorts them in the Inbox.&nbsp; On Hanselminutes Carl Franklin said that he leaves everything in the Inbox and uses a Desktop search tool.&nbsp; I am thinking that a combination of these two practices and using the Favorite Folders in Outlook would work as well.&nbsp; That way I can remove all my rules, have everything stay&nbsp;in the Inbox and at some later date I can organize as I see fit.</p><br /><p>Its going to really hurt getting ride of the rules though.&nbsp; I like my rules.</p>
