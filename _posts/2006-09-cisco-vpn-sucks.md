<p>I have to use the Cisco VPN Client at work and man when it breaks it breaks good!&nbsp; For some reason it has decided to stop working which means I can&rsquo;t work at home.&nbsp; Now I have to spend my Saterday morning in the office.&nbsp; CRAP!</p><br /><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for an alternative but can&rsquo;t seem to find one.&nbsp; If anyone knows of a good alternative please let me know.</p>
