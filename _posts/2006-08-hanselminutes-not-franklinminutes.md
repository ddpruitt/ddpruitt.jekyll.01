title: Hanselminutes - Not Franklinminutes

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2006/08/hanselminutes-not-franklinminutes.html)*.

I like listening to Scott Hanselmin on Hanselminutes.  I first noticed Scott while listening to .Net Rocks, the Podcast that was around before the term Podcast.  Scott always knows all the cool tools, the most informative websites and alternative ways (read:  Not .NET) ways of doing things.  His show is great.<br /><br />But then there is Carl.  Letâ€™s not forget that Hanselminutes is Hosted by Carl Franklin.  Carl sounds like the Java guy I work with; every time Scott brings up something that is not Microsoft or .Net Carl always comes back with â€œ.NET can do thatâ€¦â€.  Or more precisely, â€œVB.Net can do that.â€  Drives me nuts.<br /><br />Like in the show about Dynamic vs Compiled Languages Scott was making the point that TDD could take the place of a compiler in making sure your code was working.  Carl argued relentlessly that there was no way you were going to get developers to use TDD.  In my opinion Carl is missing the picture.<br /><br />Note to Carl:  Let Scott have his Minutes.
