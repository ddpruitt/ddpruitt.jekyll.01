*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://techshorts.blogspot.com/2005/08/if-we-got-this-far-then-everything-is.html)*.

<p>Comment found in a code that I was reviewing:</p><p><em>if we got this far, then everything is working properly</em></p><p>Why does this send shivers up my spine?&nbsp; The procedure is 91 lines long and this comment appears on line 43.&nbsp; What about the other 48 lines?&nbsp; What if they fail?&nbsp; </p><p>I should add the following comment to the end of the procedure:</p><p><em>if we got this far then there is a God.</em></p>
