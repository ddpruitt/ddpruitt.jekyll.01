<p><a href="http://www.mythtv.org/" target="_new"><img align="right" alt="MythTV" border="0" height="169" src="http://blog.ddpruitt.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/WindowsLiveWriter/MythTVDemoProject_9A48/MythTV_logo%5B14%5D1.png" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px;" width="240" /></a> I actually got a MythTV machine up and running yesterday!&nbsp; Man I was so excited, I have tried several times in the past but with no luck.&nbsp; However after finding a good <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV" target="_blank">How-To</a> on the Ubuntu web site I was up and running in (almost) no time.</p> <p>I have tried using <a href="http://blog.ddpruitt.net/2006/09/08/g-dingtv-viewing-linux-in-a-whole-new-way/">MythDora</a> but I could not get it to work.&nbsp; I think the reason was because of the stupid pain in the ass to set up ATI All-In-One card.&nbsp; This card has never worked right for me, either in Linux or Windows so it is time to chunk it.</p> <p>This past week I came across a <a href="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.php">How-To</a> site using Fedora Core 6 which I was prepared to follow.&nbsp; But then I got to thinking that there should be something similar for Ubuntu, which I prefer over Fedora.&nbsp; Sure enough the community site had one so I was in business.</p> <p>The first attempt I made failed.&nbsp; It failed because I attempted to install the proprietary drivers for that stupid $%^@ ATI card, something I will never attempt again with this card as it is going in the trash soon.&nbsp; So I wiped out the install and tried again, my x config file was so screwed at that point that I felt a fresh install was better.</p> <p>The second time was much better.&nbsp; I added the TV capture card with no issues, installed the MythTV server and frontend on the same machine, got my Zap2It setup and was watching TV on my PC.&nbsp; I tried to set it up to record a couple of shows as a test but that did not work.&nbsp; I'm not sure why but this is a test install any way so I'm not too worried about it working 100%.</p> <p>I showed my wife and she thought it was cool.&nbsp; This is important as the all important Wife Buy-In factor needs to be way high in order to take this project to the ultimate conclusion.&nbsp; Once I show her how to login from work and set up the server to record shows she will be good with buying some more hardware.&nbsp; Then there is the video, picture and music library that will be accessible from any where in the house once I wire the house then she will be sold.</p> <p>MythTV Rocks.</p>
